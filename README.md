## Original dataset
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult
## Introduction
Both feature-based and data-based XAI are implemented in this program. Specifically, LIME is selected as the feature-based explainer, and Monte-Carlo methoed is developed as the data-based explainer. To run the code, saved varible value should be also read, otherwise it would cost much time to run.
